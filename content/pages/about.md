  ## To understand that you cannot trust 

  opinions or advice without first understanding yourself is one of the biggest
  unknown qualities one must experience before deciding how to pursue any
  future.



  ### Failure is the BEST form of learning

  No one teaches a class in school with any real "lessons". I want to make my
  readers value these snippets of information posted. I want those that are
  reading my words to use a different part of the brain. I want you to feel an
  energy that provokes a discussion with friends and family. My opinion and
  experience will express a view that causes parents to talk to their kids after
  soaking up my point of view with questions about how the future is perceived
  and if you need to help articulate the decisions being modeled by current
  surroundings.
