excerpt: Just read an article and wanted to document the topic...

This opinion I have is based on an article from the MITPRESS. <https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/habits-of-expert-software-designers/> 

I wanted to document the habits, but soon realized that I didn't really feel the same way, so here is my rant...

Number ONE was knowing to involve the "users" when designing... This is IMO a trait that I'd hope is explicitly stated when creating ANYTHING that is intended for use by someone other than yourself. Now, it doesn't mention that the "expert" knows how to interpret data per service/product based on experience, or at least understands that there is no "one size fits all".



Number TWO states "elegant abstractions"... explaining the importance of writing \[code] that "explains itself". No one wants to decipher another persons code. It should be "readable".



Number THREE states the "essence"... or "core" sets of considerations that MUST be exact in order to have a successful design.  This point can never be over-stated. Leave the "extras" for when you have "extra" time. Build the "solution" first. Period.

Number FOUR states "simulate" continuously... which I take as "always be aware at what state the design is at, and be open to make changes to reflect that".  But the article expresses some type of notion that experts know to eat, sleep, dream the system... I dunno. Don't "overthink" it, or become too critical. Save that for after the solution is user tested...

Number FIVE states "Experts LOOK AROUND"... Hmmm .... I don't agree. I will state that during your time spent crafting your skill, you must always look at other work completed that has characteristics to copy from and best practices to utilize when designing your own body of work. I would state that "experts" (I low-key dislike this word/term...) use LESS time "looking around" at other designs due to years of experience. Obviously one should always continue their education if they want to be "great" at something, but this one doesn't work for me.

Number SIX states "reshape their problem space"... Now this one is true. It takes time and experience to take a step back to view your work from different perceptions. We train to find the "correct" approach. Then as we gain more experience, we learn that there can be more than one solution to any given task. Sometimes we can get stuck in a trance of simplifying our approach by only having a commitment to one approach we feel brings the most value, which can trend into lacking the understanding of using other solutions to add different values. Always try to be open to multiple approaches. It can be team mates or personal research, but never be so quick to dismiss everything BUT your solution that has proven "flawless".



Number SEVEN states "experts see ERROR as OPPORTUNITY"... This is also true. Nobody wants errors and bugs to come up, especially in the work environment where mistakes can be perceived as "bad". Learn to execute and know that mistakes are inevitable. Breaking something is the best way of learning how a system works, how to fix it, and how to recognize the problem in the future. It takes practice and understanding to remove the feeling one has when another person points out your mistakes.



Number EIGHT states explains experts "think about what they are NOT designing"... Okay... it's kind of counter-intuitive, but I can see what they are trying to say. It's like saying, "Know your limits, don't do extra or go in one direction that totally solves a different problem". 



Number THREE states
