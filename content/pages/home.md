# Have you ever questioned the way most of the shit that your brain soaked up over the years?

I did. My thoughts couldn't stay dormant with questions that the community of people influencing my future neglected to satisfy after so many years. I just couldn't continue to follow the "path" that was laid out. Even family members started to appear as if they didn't know how to give me guidance to be successful and happy.

How do I make money? Why am I not learning how to turn my infinite ideas and thoughts into a business? What exactly is a business? Why am I in school so long? 

Why did nobody think to make me understand how important simple problem solving was going to be for every day life? How come I never understood banks or how to save money? What if I don't want to go to college, but don't want to work in a factory?

Now, each person has their own scenario. At 35 years of age, I'm sure I would be given excuses about teachers and adults not having internet. A lot of my questions we never created with a PC or phone at my disposal either! 

## So what is all this complaining about? 

I look at my kids and wonder if other parents my age are any different. Are single adults that are my age even know these answers TODAY?

# IRONIC SUCCESS 

The name I decided on for this site comes from turning a shitty past filled with no real encouragement to succeed. My life was so bad that anyone who knew me had the same thought: "Not likely to succeed". I realized it when I turned 15. I took some time to understand why nothing looked great for my future. At the core of my findings, it was lack of knowing what the fuck I was even doing! Ever since then I took a different path that now allows me to provide for my 3 kids and wife, make better decisions, and continue pushing myself to make more money. 

In order to end up where I am now, I had to FAIL. I failed A LOT. I didn't trust anyone to show me the path, so I continued taking risks, making mistakes and hitting dead ends for years. But I learned from every failure and built a blueprint for myself that gave me the tools I needed to succeed.
