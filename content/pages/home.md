##### I never had a childhood that promoted anything involving how to solve every-day problems in the real world. Common sense eluded me during the years in school. I honestly cannot recall any authoritative figures showing any interest on how to "solve a problem". I was under the impression that any assignment was needed to be completed because that grading system reflected a future of some unknown success that is only revealed in pieces based on opinions from people that had no business handling my impressions as I look back on it.

I was just a "unit". Un-diagnosed "A.D.D" along with unnoticed signs of being "introvert" made it seem like gaining attention or receiving life advice was something only in the movies.
